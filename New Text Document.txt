hello Angular
==>observable is a asynchronous programming
==>if any change in data observable give the notification
==>observer:- it will keep the track of change in data
==>of method is used for type casting(array of data into Observable)
==>if you ad some more data in future then it must get reflected so observable is used
==>x=>x.id===id in line function
==>'filter' will iterate through all the records & go to all data but 'find' search for particular data
==>In angular Constructors are generally used for dependency injection
==>in angualar  the constrctor used to inject the dependenciess
   ex)constrctor(private user:userService){}
=> Data from parent to child use @input() in child component
=> Data from child to parent use @output()
=>Custom Directives used for change the DOM 
=>Add ElementRef in the directive's constructor() to inject a reference to the
  host DOM element, the element to which you apply appHighlight.
=> ElementRef used to access DOM element and manipulate it
  & it has native element property that contains all the properties of DOM element
  ex) in react document.getelementbyId("hello");
